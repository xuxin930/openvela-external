# External Introduction

\[ English | [简体中文](README_zh-cn.md) \]

This project is organized in a way that the top-level repository (super repository) manages multiple sub-repositories. In this way, different parts of the code base can be better managed and maintained while ensuring the independence and flexibility of each sub-repository. The sub-repository starts with the `external` field.
